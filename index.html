									<h2><a href="#">Finding The<br />
									Right Place</a></h2>
									<p>When temperatures start to drop, many people want to stay inside to keep warm. 
                                        For others, cold weather is an opportunity to pick up their hobby of skiing. 
                                        Whether you are a seasoned veteran or have never touched snow, skiing is an exciting sport to try. 
                                        Finding the right place to ski is a challenging task with many factors to consider, such as 
                                        location and price. This can make deciding on your next destination difficult. We will be 
                                        taking a closer look at data from ski resorts across Europe to understand skiing
                                        in different countries better. </p>
								</header>

									<h2>Looking for Answers</h2>
									<p>I looked at a dataset from Kaggle that took data from across Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, France, and Italy. I specifically chose to look 
										at the resorts from the dataset and compare their prices. I sought to figure out how skiing compares across different European countries. 
										Which countries have the most expensive resorts, and which have the cheapest resorts? 
										Do countries with fewer resorts tend to be more expensive? </p>

									<h2>How To Use</h2>
									<p>Start by clicking on one of the countries or using the "Highlight Country" search bar to highlight a specific country. 
										Once you have selected a specific country to inspect, you can look at the average price of resorts and snowfall for that country.
										</p>

									<p>To compare the average price of resorts, a packed bubble chart was used. 
										Each bubble represents one resort, and the color of the bubble corresponds to the color of 
										the country on the map. The more circles there are of a certain color, the more resorts there 
										are for that country. The size of each circle was calculated by taking the average price of all 
										the hotels located at that resort.</p>
									<p>Austria and France had the highest amount of resorts and the highest average prices. 
										In comparison, Bulgaria and Andorra had fewer and cheaper resorts. I had expected the 
										countries with fewer resorts to be more expensive because I thought it would mean
										there would be less competition. </p>
									<p>Next, I wanted to see how high the average snowfall was for each country.
										To do this, I used a bar chart. France had the higher average snowfall, which is understandable 
										considering the number of resorts in France. With Austria having so many resorts, I was 
										surprised that the average snowfall wasn’t as high as other countries. Finland and 
										Bulgaria had the lowest snowfall, which makes sense, considering both countries had the 
										least amount of resorts.  </p>
									<p>France experienced a dramatic decrease in snowfall in December, while Italy’s average snowfall 
										remained relatively the same. Overall, France seems to rank the best in terms of snowfall and 
										the number of resorts. </p>

									<p>Next, I wanted to see how the number of runs and lifts compared across countries. 
										To do this, I used a scatterplot. As expected, an overall 
										positive correlation existed between the total runs and the total lifts, although a few 
										countries, like Bulgaria, averaged more lifts than runs. France had the most runs and lifts by far. 
									</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>Overall, France is the place to go if you are looking for somewhere in Europe to ski, with plenty of 
										options in resorts, ski runs, and lifts. In terms of price, Italy is a great alternative to France 
										due to its lower average prices. Ultimately, it all comes down to personal preferences, but 
										no matter where you go, it will be enjoyable.  </p>
